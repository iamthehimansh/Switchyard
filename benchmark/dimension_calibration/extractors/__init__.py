"""Trajectory-to-prompt extractors for the dimension-collector calibration corpus.

Each extractor turns one harness run (currently: Harbor episode dirs) into a
stream of :class:`ScoredPrompt` records the calibration runner consumes. Two
scoring scopes per prompt:

* ``full`` — the concatenated message blob the proxy actually sees in
  production. System prompt, prior tool results, and tool calls all in.
* ``latest`` — the most recent user-role text content only. Cleaner signal
  isolation; useful as a counterpoint to ``full``.
