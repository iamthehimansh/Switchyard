# Contributing to Switchyard

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines the development workflow, testing practices, and code standards.

## Setup

See [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full setup instructions.

Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-dev/switchyard.git
cd switchyard
uv sync
uvx pre-commit install --install-hooks --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branch naming

Use one of these prefixes for clarity:

- `feature/...` — new functionality
- `fix/...` — bug fixes
- `docs/...` — documentation updates
- `refactor/...` — non-functional code changes
- `test/...` — test additions or improvements

Example: `feature/add-new-router-backend` or `fix/async-context-leak`

### 2. Code standards

All code must pass these gates before a PR is merged:

```bash
# Linting — zero errors required
uv run ruff check .

# Type checking — strict mode
uv run mypy switchyard

# Tests — no failures
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

These commands run in CI on every push. **Fix linting errors locally before pushing:**

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

### 3. Commit messages

Commit messages must follow
[Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
This is enforced locally by the `commit-msg` hook and in GitHub Actions.

- ✓ `fix: handle async context cleanup in ProxyContext`
- ✓ `feat: add cascade routing backend`
- ✗ `Fixed stuff` / `Updated code`

Use one of:

- `build:` — build system or packaging changes
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `ci:` — CI configuration
- `docs:` — documentation
- `refactor:` — code structure (no behavior change)
- `test:` — test additions
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `chore:` — tooling, dependencies, CI
- `revert:` — revert a previous commit
- `style:` — formatting-only changes

Scopes are optional: `fix(cli): preserve launcher args`.
Breaking changes use `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```text
feat(api)!: remove legacy route option
```

### 4. Pull request process

1. **Create a feature branch** off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Write tests** for new functionality or bug fixes. Tests live in `tests/`:
   - Unit tests: `tests/test_*.py`

3. **Run the full test suite locally** before pushing:
   ```bash
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run mypy switchyard
   uv run pytest tests/ -v
   ```

4. **Push and open a PR** on GitHub. Include:
   - Clear description of the change and why
   - Link to any related issues (e.g., "Closes #42")
   - Test coverage notes

5. **Address review feedback** — push additional commits (don't force-push unless explicitly asked).

6. **Squash and merge** when approved. One commit per feature keeps history clean.
   Keep the PR title conventional too, because GitHub can use the PR title for
   the squash-merge commit.

Maintainers should mark these GitHub status checks as required on `main`:

- `Commitlint / Commit messages`
- `PR Title / Validate PR title`

## Testing

### Unit tests (fast, no API keys)

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Integration tests (requires API keys)

Integration tests hit live LLM APIs. Set credentials before running:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# or NVIDIA_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY depending on the backend you target
```

The default unit test suite runs with no network access and no API keys. Live, end-to-end tests are not currently part of the public CI pipeline.

## Architecture

See [Agents](AGENTS.md) for the full architecture guide. Key points:

- **Typed requests/responses** — use `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` subtypes
- **Composable chain** — `RequestProcessor` → `LLMBackend` → `ResponseProcessor` → `TranslationEngine`
- **Recipes** — pre-built chains in `switchyard/lib/recipes.py`

When adding a new component:

1. Decide the role: `RequestProcessor`, `LLMBackend`, `ResponseProcessor`, or translation engine work.
2. Subclass the ABC from `switchyard/lib/roles.py`.
3. Put Python middleware in the matching subpackage (`switchyard/lib/processors/`, `switchyard/lib/backends/`) and provider translation logic in `crates/switchyard-translation`.
4. Add tests in `tests/`.
5. Export from the relevant `__init__.py` and from `switchyard/__init__.py`'s `__all__`.

## Documentation

- **Code comments** — explain the *why*, not the *what*. One line max unless complex.
- **Docstrings** — include for public APIs. Format: one-line summary, blank line, details, examples.
- **README** — keep in sync with CLI surface (commands, flags, new subcommands).
- **docs/** — architecture, design decisions, advanced usage.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. See [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "feat: add cool feature"
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
