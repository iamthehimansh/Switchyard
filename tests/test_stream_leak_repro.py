"""Empirical repro: unclosed streaming responses exhaust the httpx pool, and our
SSE-helper close path releases the connection.

Uses the REAL OpenAI ``AsyncStream`` against a loopback SSE server, with the
httpx pool capped at a single connection so exhaustion is deterministic. The
stream is driven through the real ``iter_chat_completion_sse`` helper, so the
``finally: await _aclose_stream(...)`` we added is the thing under test.

Marked ``integration`` (real sockets + a pool timeout) so the default unit gate
can deselect it with ``-m "not integration"``; it is the canonical regression
for the OOM connection-pool leak.
