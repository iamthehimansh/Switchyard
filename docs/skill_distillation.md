# Skill Distillation

Skill distillation turns agent sessions into a reusable skill for the same
kind of work. The model is not retrained. Switchyard saves the session history,
uses it to update a `SKILL.md`, and makes the active skill available to later
agent launches for the same namespace.

The current release adds the saved configuration and the Rust contracts that
later implementations will share. It does not yet save session files, run
distillation, update skills, import external runs, validate results, or mount
skills into launched agents.

## Configure It

Choose a short namespace for the task or workflow you want the skill to learn:

```bash
switchyard configure --skill-distillation tooluniverse-trialqa
switchyard configure --show
```

One namespace identifies one skill that improves over time. Keep using the same
namespace when more sessions or trajectories should contribute to that skill;
choose a different namespace when you want a separate skill. A namespace is not
a session ID. In the automatic workflow, Switchyard will generate a separate
internal session ID for each launcher run.

The namespace is stored in the user config and can be updated without provider
credentials. To remove it:

```bash
switchyard configure --disable-skill-distillation
```

## Intended Workflow

Once launcher support lands, the flow should be automatic:

```text
configure a namespace
run an agent through switchyard launch
save the session under that namespace
distill when the session ends
create or update the namespace's active SKILL.md
load that active skill in the next launch for the same namespace
```

If no skill exists yet, the first distilled session creates one. Later sessions
update the existing skill and keep enough history to inspect or roll back the
change.

Skill distillation is namespace-based. The namespace is saved user
configuration, not a per-request header. A future request may be recorded as
part of a saved session, but a single HTTP request should not change which skill
is being learned or used.

## Session Ownership

The user configures only the namespace. In the automatic workflow, Switchyard
will own session capture and the session lifecycle. Each `switchyard launch`
will generate a separate session ID, record completed model turns as they pass
through the local proxy, and finalize the project-local session record when the
launched agent exits. The user will not provide a session ID, choose a storage
path, or run a separate recorder.

The capture backend is an internal implementation detail. The initial
implementation will use a Switchyard-managed project-local store; a later
trajectory source or storage backend can replace or supplement it without
changing the configuration or launcher workflow.

## Config

Skill distillation config is stored in `~/.config/switchyard/config.json` under
the top-level `skill_distillation` key:

```json
{
  "skill_distillation": {
    "namespace": "tooluniverse-trialqa"
  }
}
```

The config is intentionally small:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `namespace` | unset | Stable name for one skill that improves over time. Many sessions or trajectories can contribute to it; it is not a session ID. |

Namespaces must be safe local path components: letters, numbers, dot,
underscore, and hyphen only. They cannot be `.` or `..`.

The top-level `skill_distillation` key is omitted when skill distillation is
not configured. `namespace` is the only supported key today. Extra manually
edited keys are rejected instead of being treated as inactive future options.

## Decisions

Generated output should stay portable and easy to review. Switchyard should
write `SKILL.md` and human-readable reports, not generated Python or other
executable files.

Skill generation should happen after sessions finish, not during normal model
request handling. Switchyard owns the session-to-skill lifecycle, including
capture, distillation, validation, history, and launch-time skill loading. It
should not turn every request into a memory update.

The automatic workflow still needs guardrails. Every skill update should record
which sessions supported it, keep the previous active skill available for
rollback, and produce review output. Later checks should flag answer leakage,
source IDs, URLs, benchmark shortcuts, and task-specific details before a skill
is trusted.

## Planned Store Layout

Future work should use inspectable local files:

```text
<project>/.switchyard/skill-distillation/<namespace>/
  sessions/<session-id>/
    session.json
    turns.jsonl
    stats.json
  distillation-ledger.jsonl
  candidates/<version-id>/
    skill/SKILL.md
    report.md
  active/SKILL.md
  history.jsonl
```

The ledger should track which saved sessions have already contributed to a
skill update. That lets distillation use new sessions by default instead of
depending on a long-lived lookback-count setting.

## Rust Contracts

The `switchyard-skill-distillation` crate defines the source-neutral records
and extension points shared by future implementations and adapters. It does not
choose a provider, storage format, agent runtime, or model implementation.

The public contract includes:

- safe `SkillNamespace`, `SkillEvidenceId`, and `SkillVersionId` identifiers;
- versioned trajectories with task, execution, source, event, and outcome data;
- versioned skill candidates with required source-evidence provenance and
  optional validation reports; and
- async `TrajectorySource`, `SkillDistiller`, `SkillValidator`, and `SkillStore`
  traits.

The traits define workflow steps, but they do not run by themselves. No
production Switchyard code uses them today. A Switchyard runtime must load
saved trajectories and the active skill, build a distillation request, create
and check a candidate, then save it and decide whether to make it active. This
crate does not choose the code that implements each trait or decide when those
steps run.

`SkillEvidenceId` is not a second session tracker. A session ID groups requests
and turns while an agent is running. A `SkillEvidenceId` identifies the
completed run after Switchyard saves it for distillation. The initial workflow
will create one evidence record for each completed launcher session. Switchyard
keeps this ID stable within the namespace. The Rust contract uses it to reject
duplicate inputs in one distillation request and to record which evidence a
skill candidate used. The code that creates an evidence record reuses a safe
session ID or derives the evidence ID from it in a repeatable way. It can keep
the original run or session ID in `TrajectorySourceInfo.id`.

Provider-specific event data stays inside JSON payload and metadata fields.
The crate validates record invariants but does not redact source data, run a
model, write files, or activate a candidate by itself. Adapters and runtime
implementations own those operations.
