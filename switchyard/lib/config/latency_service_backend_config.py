"""Configuration models for the Latency Service usage case.

``LatencyServiceEndpoint`` describes one LLM backend monitored by the
Latency Service.  ``LatencyServiceBackendConfig`` bundles the full
backend configuration — URL of the Latency Service, the endpoint list,
and polling/retry parameters.

The ``model`` field on each endpoint doubles as the endpoint ID used by
the Latency Service's health API — mirroring the routing-by-model-name
convention the rest of the library already follows.

class LatencyServiceEndpoint(BaseModel):
    """One LLM backend registered with the Latency Service.

    The ``model`` field is the endpoint ID used by the Latency Service —
    it must be unique across the endpoint list and it is the value the
    Latency Service returns health verdicts under.  By default it is also
    the value written into ``body["model"]`` when calling the upstream;
    set ``upstream_model`` when the upstream expects a different name
    (e.g. routing the latency-service key ``"openai/gpt-5.5"`` through an
    IH gateway that expects ``"openai/openai/gpt-5.5"``).

    Attributes:
        model: Latency-service lookup key.  Must be unique across the
            endpoint list.  Also used as ``body["model"]`` unless
            ``upstream_model`` is set.
        upstream_model: Optional override for ``body["model"]`` sent to
            the upstream LLM.  Defaults to ``model`` when ``None``.
        api_key: API key for the backing LLM API.
        base_url: Base URL for the backing LLM API (include ``/v1``).
        timeout: Request timeout in seconds, forwarded to the underlying
            ``OpenAILLMClient``.  ``None`` uses the client default.
        request_type: Upstream OpenAI API surface used for this endpoint.
            ``"openai_chat"`` sends ``/v1/chat/completions``; ``"openai_responses"``
            sends ``/v1/responses`` for Responses-only upstream models.

    Attributes:
        latency_service_url: Base URL of the Latency Service
            (e.g. ``"http://latency-service.inference-hub.svc:8080"``).
        endpoints: LLM backends to route across.  Each must have a
            unique ``model`` — this is the routing + health-lookup key.
        poll_interval_s: How often the background poller refreshes
            health from the Latency Service.  Health is cached between
            polls; the request hot path never blocks on a network call.
        poll_timeout_s: Timeout for the health API call.
        max_retries: On error, retry on a different endpoint up to this
            many times.  Dedup prevents re-selecting an endpoint that
            already failed for the same request.
        credential_policy: Which credential wins when the inbound HTTP
            request carries a caller key.  ``"configured_endpoint"`` keeps
            using each endpoint's configured ``api_key``; ``"caller_override"``
            opts into BYO-key forwarding.
        session_affinity: When ``True``, pin each conversation to the endpoint
            that first served it (cache stays warm); a pin is broken only when
            its endpoint degrades or the call fails. Per process. Default off.
        affinity_max_sessions: Bounded-LRU cap on pinned conversations; ignored
            when ``session_affinity`` is off.
        enable_stats: When ``True`` (default), the factory wires a
            :class:`StatsRequestProcessor` + :class:`StatsResponseProcessor`
            pair sharing one :class:`StatsAccumulator` and wraps the
            backend in :class:`StatsLlmBackend`, so the chain contributes
            ``GET /metrics``, ``GET /v1/stats``, and the legacy
            ``GET /v1/routing/stats`` aliases via the standard
            ``get_endpoint()`` mechanism in :func:`build_switchyard_app`.
