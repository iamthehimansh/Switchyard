"""Optional Datadog (ddtrace) spans for the proxy routing path.

Switchyard runs inside a proxy that owns the Datadog APM trace. These helpers
add child spans and tags around the route-decision and upstream-attempt blocks
so routing behaviour is visible in APM.

``ddtrace`` is an **optional** dependency (the ``tracing`` extra). When it is
not installed the helpers are complete no-ops with no overhead, so the default
install and non-Datadog deployments are unaffected. When it is installed, the
spans created here nest under whatever span the surrounding proxy already has
active, so they appear inline in the proxy's trace.
