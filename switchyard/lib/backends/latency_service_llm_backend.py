"""``LLMBackend`` that routes across many endpoints by Latency Service verdicts.

This is the usage case for Inference Hub deployments where a central
Latency Service owns heartbeat probing and statistical profiling.  The
backend holds a pool of ``OpenAILLMClient`` instances keyed by model ID,
reads health verdicts from a locally-cached map maintained by a
:class:`HealthPoller` daemon thread, and picks a healthy endpoint on
every request.

Chain integration::

    request-side work → LatencyServiceLLMBackend → response-side work → TranslationEngine

Request-format translation is delegated to
:class:`switchyard_rust.translation.TranslationEngine` after an endpoint is
selected, so Chat endpoints keep receiving Chat Completions while
Responses-mode endpoints receive the OpenAI Responses API natively.

    :class:`HealthPoller` daemon thread that refreshes the in-memory

       candidate has a known sample; otherwise it falls back to uniform

    2. Translate the request to that endpoint's configured OpenAI API
       surface and override the body's ``model`` with the selected endpoint ID.

       (429 / 408 / 5xx / network), retry with a different endpoint
       (dedup prevents re-selecting the same one within a single
