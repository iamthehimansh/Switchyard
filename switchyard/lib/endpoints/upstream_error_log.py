"""Structured per-attempt upstream-failure log for Loki ingestion.

The aggregate ``switchyard_upstream_attempts_total`` counter on ``/metrics``
answers "how many of each error code" but, by Prometheus' data model, holds
no per-event timestamps. This module is its per-event complement: it emits
one JSON line per *failed* upstream attempt on a dedicated logger, carrying
the exact event timestamp so a Loki/Grafana pipeline can audit, replay, or
plot individual failures.

The line *is* a JSON object (not a human sentence with structured ``extra``)
on purpose: Switchyard configures plain-text logging via ``logging.basicConfig``
with no JSON formatter, so embedding the document in the message is what makes
``| json`` work in a Loki query with zero deployment-side formatter config.
The dedicated ``switchyard.upstream_errors`` logger still propagates to the
root handler, so the line also shows on the console.

The ``code`` and ``outcome`` fields are computed with the same helpers as the
metric labels (:func:`~switchyard.lib.endpoints.outcome_metrics.code_label`,
:func:`~switchyard.lib.endpoints.outcome_metrics.classify`) so the event log
joins cleanly to ``switchyard_upstream_attempts_total``.
