"""Process-wide table for objects that contribute extra ``/metrics`` lines.

The accumulator-derived exposition rendered by
:func:`switchyard.lib.prometheus_exposition.render_prometheus` covers
request flow (counts, tokens, latency). Components that own state which
is not request-derived — Latency Service verdicts, poll-loop health,
endpoint-level live samples — register an emitter here so their lines
appear on the same ``/metrics`` scrape rather than a sidecar URL.

Single-process table by design: a Switchyard server is one process,
emitters are owned by component lifetimes, and the table is
write-once-read-many across startup.
