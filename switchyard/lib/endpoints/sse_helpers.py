"""Shared SSE serialization helpers for HTTP endpoints.

Pure async generators that turn typed response streams into the raw
SSE frames FastAPI's ``StreamingResponse`` expects.  Each wire format
(OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, Responses API) has its
own helper with the format-specific framing contract.

Error contract (shared across all helpers):
(:mod:`switchyard.server.endpoints.openai_endpoint`):

- The endpoint awaits ``switchyard.call()`` *before* handing the stream
  to ``StreamingResponse``, so upstream auth / connection / rate-limit
  failures raise exceptions that the global handler turns into proper
  HTTP error responses.
- Only failures during chunk iteration land in ``except`` here.  At
  that point HTTP 200 has already been committed, so the best we can
  do is emit a final SSE error frame (format-specific shape).

    Anthropic's SSE contract carries a named event per frame (unlike

    event name comes from each event's ``"type"`` field —
    ``message_start``, ``content_block_delta``, ``message_stop``, etc.

    Accepts two producer shapes:

    * Plain ``dict`` events (from ``stream_openai_to_anthropic`` when
      the chain translates OpenAI → Anthropic on the fly).
    * Pydantic ``RawMessageStreamEvent`` models (from the Anthropic
      SDK's ``AsyncStream`` when the backend speaks Anthropic natively
      — see :class:`AnthropicNativeBackend`). Serialized via
      ``model_dump(exclude_none=True)``.

    No ``[DONE]`` terminator: Anthropic signals end-of-stream with a
    ``message_stop`` event, not a sentinel frame.

    Mid-stream iteration failures emit a final ``event: error`` frame
    with an ``{"error": {...}}`` payload and terminate — same error
