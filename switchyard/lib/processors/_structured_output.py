"""Strict-mode JSON-schema helpers for OpenAI Structured Outputs.

Shared between :mod:`switchyard.lib.processors.llm_classifier` and
:mod:`switchyard.lib.processors.plan_execute` so the two routers stay in
lock-step on how they ask the upstream model to constrain its JSON
output. Both routers build their ``response_format`` payload via
:func:`build_response_format`; both rely on
:func:`to_strict_openai_schema` to translate a pydantic
``model_json_schema()`` into the subset OpenAI accepts under
``strict: true``.
