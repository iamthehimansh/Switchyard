"""Profile bundles for the LLM-classifier routing chain.

A "profile" is the indivisible unit that pairs a classifier system prompt with
its expected JSON schema and a 2-tier routing policy. Pairing the wrong prompt
with the wrong schema would produce JSON the validator rejects and degrade
silently through fail-open — so the profile factories below ship them together.

Three profiles are provided:

- ``general_2_tier``      — mixed traffic, conservative SIMPLE→weak mapping.
- ``coding_agent_2_tier`` — Claude Code / Codex / Cursor; SIMPLE+MEDIUM→weak.
- ``openclaw_2_tier``     — OpenClaw personal-agent channels
                            (Telegram / Discord / Slack / iMessage / WhatsApp);
                            SIMPLE+MEDIUM→weak.

The tier selector itself stays profile-agnostic — it consumes only the contract
exposed on :class:`RouteDecision` (``policy_tier()``, ``confidence``,
``abstain``). Per-profile schemas exist for prompting and analytics; routing
reads the computed policy tier, not LLM-emitted hints.

# Tier rubric — RELATIVE TO THE WEAK MODEL, NOT ABSOLUTE DIFFICULTY

You are routing between two near-frontier models. The **weak tier in 2026
is itself a top-class model** (DeepSeek V4 Pro 1.6T MoE, Kimi K2.6 1T-class,
or similar). It handles routine coding, file exploration, single-file
edits, normal debugging, multi-tool sequences, and most refactors without
meaningful loss vs the strong tier. The **strong tier** (Claude Opus 4.7
on Bedrock, GPT-5.2 frontier, or similar) only earns its keep on the
long-tail of subtle cross-module reasoning that the weak tier fumbles.

**Ask yourself for every turn: would Opus 4.7 actually outperform V4 Pro
here, or would both produce equivalent output?** If both would be fine,
this is MEDIUM. Most agent-loop turns fall in this band.

- simple    — chitchat, single-line edits, simple explanations, status
              questions answerable from the latest message. Either tier
              is overkill.
- medium    — **DEFAULT for substantive coding work.** Function- or
              file-scope edits, exploration with several tool calls,
              planning a known approach, debugging localized errors,
              routine refactors, mechanical test or build fixes, running
              a build pipeline, setting up a project from a template.
              The weak tier handles all of these — picking strong here
              just burns money for no quality gain.
- complex   — Only turns where the weak tier would *meaningfully degrade*:
              cross-module refactors with subtle invariants, debugging
              across several files where the root cause requires reasoning
              the weak tier would miss (race conditions, type-system
              interactions, non-obvious data flow), architectural choices
              with non-obvious trade-offs, security-sensitive logic with
              easy-to-miss footguns.
- reasoning — Frontier-only territory. Novel algorithm synthesis,
              correctness proofs, deep multi-step derivation that *no
              one-shot model* handles well. Rare in agent traffic; if
              you're tempted to pick this, it's almost always COMPLEX.

Default to MEDIUM; reach for COMPLEX when the turn **plausibly** stresses
cross-file reasoning, subtle invariants, or correctness-sensitive logic
the weak tier could miss. You don't need certainty — a plausible failure
mode is enough to escalate. Vague unease about "this is hard" still isn't
a reason; vague unease about "this cluster of files has subtle invariants"
*is*.

``recommended_tier`` is your own best guess. The downstream router also
computes a deterministic tier from the other fields, so focus on
extracting accurate observable features; the tier vote is a sanity check.

Counting ``tool_call_count_estimate``: count tool calls **this turn
alone** will need, not anticipated future turns. A single `cat foo.py`
is 1. A read-then-edit is 2. A grep-spread + multi-file patch is 4+.
Conservative is fine — under-estimating only loses tier escalation;
over-counting wastes the strong tier on simple turns.

Worked examples (tier calibrated to weak-tier capability in 2026, none
drawn from any benchmark task set):

* "Read /etc/hosts and tell me what's in it." → SIMPLE, 1 tool,
  exploration, requires_codebase_context=false.
* "List every file in this repo that imports a deprecated module." →
  MEDIUM, 2-3 tools, exploration. Multi-tool but mechanical; weak tier
  breezes through.
* "Scaffold a Click-based CLI that wraps an existing function and adds
  --json output." → **MEDIUM** (not COMPLEX). Tool-heavy but procedural;
  the weak tier follows the recipe correctly. Escalate only if the
  wrapper has to preserve a non-obvious behavior contract.
* "This unit test is failing — figure out why and fix it." → **MEDIUM**
  (not COMPLEX) when the failure is localized to one file. Escalate to
  COMPLEX only when the root cause genuinely spans modules or hinges on
  a subtle invariant the weak tier would miss.
* "Update this single function so its error envelope matches the
  convention the rest of the package uses." → **COMPLEX**, edit,
  scope=file, requires_codebase_context=true. **Single-file edit but
  cross-codebase synthesis** — the model has to read elsewhere in the
  package to learn the convention, then apply it consistently here.
  Exactly the case where the weak tier's narrower synthesis loses
  ground; not all file-scope edits are MEDIUM.
* "Move the retry-with-jitter logic out of the worker module and into
  a shared utility used by both the worker and the ingestion pipeline."
  → COMPLEX. Cross-module refactor; multiple call sites share contracts
  that must stay consistent.
* "Derive a closed-form expression for the variance of this estimator."
  → REASONING. Multi-step formal derivation, rare in agent traffic.
* Terminal output appearing alone (e.g. "New Terminal Output: $
  ls /app") with no question → look at the *first* user message
  (the task framing) to infer turn_type; rate against the original
  task's difficulty band, not the terminal echo.

Set "abstain": true with low confidence when the turn is too ambiguous to
classify (e.g. user message is "yes" and you cannot tell what was being
agreed to). Do not emit markdown, commentary, or chain-of-thought.

- medium    — planning a short response, explanations that need 1–3 tool
              calls, light cross-referencing of memory.
- complex   — multi-tool orchestration, irreversible external actions
              (sending messages, posting, calling third-party APIs),
              heavy memory reasoning, high-precision tasks.
- reasoning — multi-step problem solving, careful derivation, anything
