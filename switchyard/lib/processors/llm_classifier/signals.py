"""Strongly typed signal vocabulary for LLM classifier routing.

Each routing profile (general chat, coding agent, OpenClaw personal agent)
defines its own pydantic schema. All schemas share a minimal contract —
:class:`RouteDecision` — so the downstream tier selector can stay
profile-agnostic.

The base contract exposes:

* :attr:`RouteDecision.recommended_tier` — the LLM's own vote, captured
  verbatim from the classifier output. Kept for audit / comparison only;
  routing does **not** read it.
* :attr:`RouteDecision.confidence` — calibration signal used by the
  tier-selector's confidence floor.
* :attr:`RouteDecision.abstain` — explicit "too ambiguous to classify"
  marker that forces the selector to its default tier.
* :meth:`RouteDecision.policy_tier` — a deterministic, code-derived
  tier computed from the profile-specific feature set. **This is what
  the tier selector routes on.** Each subclass implements it as a small
  scoring scheme over its observable features.

Splitting "extract features" (LLM) from "decide tier" (Python) makes the
policy testable, replayable from captured signals, and tunable without
re-prompting. When ``policy_tier()`` disagrees with the LLM's
``recommended_tier``, that's a signal for the operator to investigate —
both values are persisted in :class:`TierSelectionDecision`.
