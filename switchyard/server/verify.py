"""End-to-end installation verifier for the launchers.

Mirrors the ``launch_claude`` / ``launch_codex`` / ``launch_openclaw``
flow but, instead of dropping the user into an interactive TUI, runs a
sequenced checklist and reports pass/fail for each step.  Four modes:

* :func:`verify_proxy` — backend + chain only.  No harness binary
  needed.  Catches credential / network / translation drift in seconds.
* :func:`verify_claude` — proxy + spawn ``claude -p "..."``.  Full
  end-to-end through Claude Code's CLI.
* :func:`verify_codex` — proxy + spawn ``codex exec "..."``.  Full
  end-to-end through Codex's CLI (with the same ``-c`` provider
  overrides ``launch_codex`` uses, so this validates the wire shape too).
* :func:`verify_openclaw` — proxy + spawn ``openclaw agent --local
  --message ... --json`` against a transient OpenClaw workspace
  identical to ``launch_openclaw``'s, so any drift in the JSON5
  config schema surfaces here.  Note ``verify_openclaw`` uses the
  one-shot ``agent`` subcommand because it has to exit cleanly without
  a TTY; ``launch_openclaw`` uses the interactive ``chat`` subcommand.

Designed to double as our offline e2e production gate: a pytest test
that shells out to ``switchyard verify <mode>`` and asserts
``returncode == 0`` protects the user-facing UX automatically.

The checklist runner intentionally writes to ``sys.stdout`` rather than
a logger — verify is *the* command users run to confirm their install,
and a checklist pinned to print semantics renders cleanly in CI logs,
plain terminals, and ``capture_output=True`` subprocess captures.
